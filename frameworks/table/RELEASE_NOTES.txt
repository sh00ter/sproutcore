This is a quick draft of what should be release notes for SC.TableView

SC.TableView is a composite view that displays a table with a header, columns and rows of data.

An SC.TableView contains a ScrollView which renders an SC.DataView to display data. SC.DataView extends SC.ListView.

Currently working features are:
- incremental rendering,
- dynamic columns,
- dynamic datasource,
- click a header to sort,
- drag a header to reoder columns
- drag a headers handle to resize a column
- drag to reorder content
- inline editing
- foldered tableview
- custom scrollview
- custom exampleview - NOTE: an exampleView in SC.TableView is for cells, not rows!!!
- optional headers
- custom header heights
- custom (but uniform, for now) row heights

Still to be done:
- structural stabilization (I assume)
- cell based selection

Known issues:
- Currently rowViews are not pooled, only cell views are. This should be improved.
